## Anarix AI Agent Task

This project is the Challenge Provided by the Anarix to create a AI-powered E-Commerce data assistant that:

    - Understands the Natural Language Questions
    - Converets them to the any Database Query (I have selected the PostgreSQL) using the LLM (Gemini-2.5-flash)
    - Returns the tabulated response in the terminal using the tabulate library
    - Visualizes the results as graphs when applicable
